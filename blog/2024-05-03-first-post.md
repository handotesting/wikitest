You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}  
def print\_hi(name)  
puts "Hi, #{name}"  
end  
print\_hi('Tom')  
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.

Check out the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home) for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/).
